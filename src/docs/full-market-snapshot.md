**MCPToolName** `get_snapshot_all`

**Description:**

Retrieve a comprehensive snapshot of the entire U.S. stock market, covering over 10,000+ actively traded tickers in a single response. This endpoint consolidates key information like pricing, volume, and trade activity to provide a full-market-snapshot view, eliminating the need for multiple queries.
